<h1>LINUX</h1>
<br>
<p>
Linux (/ˈlɪnəks/ (About this soundlisten) LIN-əks) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
<br><br>
Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.
Linux est le meilleur système d'exploitation, enfin, si on ne compte pas windows.
